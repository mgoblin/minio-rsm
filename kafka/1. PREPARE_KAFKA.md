# How to prepare Kafka to tiered storage testing

## Tune config
Config contains some host specific paths. Find places in server.properties files marked 
as # Change on and adjust parameters to your host.

## Prepare Apache Kafka to KRaft mode
For using Kafka in KRaft mode you should generate UUID for storage and 
then format storage to KRaft mode.
```Bash
cd /home/mike/Projects/kafka/kafka_2.13-3.7.1
```

1. generate UUID
```Bash
bin/kafka-storage.sh random-uuid
```
The result is generated UUID after bash script finished.
```Bash
fBj1dVW1TJKkwKhr1Q6u5g
```
2. Format storage for Kraft
```Bash
bin/kafka-storage.sh format \
-t fBj1dVW1TJKkwKhr1Q6u5g \
-c /home/mike/Projects/kafka/minio-rsm/kafka/config/kraft/server.properties
```
3. Run kafka broker in the terminal
```Bash
bin/kafka-server-start.sh -daemon \
/home/mike/Projects/kafka/minio-rsm/kafka/config/kraft/server.properties
```
4. Stop Kafka broker in the terminal
```Bash
bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
```

5. Unpack and copy remote storage libs.<br/>
Remote storage distribution after source code build placed to 
./naive-rsm/build/distribution folder as tar and zip archives.
